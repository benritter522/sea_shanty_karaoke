## Design

This app was made using React Native and Expo CLI. 

Some improvements to be made:
1. Configuring the Flatlist of lyrics to automatically focus on certain lyrics--namely, the highlighted line.
2. Rendering many SongPages in a Flatlist inside of a component SongPagesList.
3. Formatting the SongPagesList to show each SongPage on the full screen in a horizontal list, snapping to each full-page song. Perhaps with a nice page flip animation and a background that looks like parchment.
4. Creating a server to host data for the lyrics and music files on the backend.
5. Styling everything a bit more creatively.
