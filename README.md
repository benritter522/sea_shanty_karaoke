# Sea Shanty Karaoke

Sea Shanty App is a karaoke app for learning sea shanties, so you can learn to sing like a pirate.

## Installation

Stay tuned for instructions on downloading the app!

## Usage

Simply press the play button and learn to sing along! More songs coming soon.

## Design

This app was made using React Native and Expo CLI. 

Improvements to be made include:
-Configuring the Flatlist of lyrics to automatically focus on certain lyrics--namely, the highlighted line.
-Rendering many SongPages in a Flatlist inside of a component SongPagesList.
-Formatting the SongPagesList to show each SongPage on the full screen in a horizontal list, snapping to each full-page song. Perhaps with a nice page flip animation and a background that looks like parchment.
-Creating a server to host data for the lyrics and music files on the backend.
-Styling everything a bit more creatively.
